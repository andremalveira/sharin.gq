## Sharin.gq

### Custom preview link to share

At one point I needed to share a url, but this url had no metadata on its page, and as we know a good share is when it shows the metadata of that url, such as a title, description, image and site name.

Because of that I created this free tool in which you can add a url with title, description and image and share it with a preview of this information.

## How to use

> ### Url Example
```js
https://sharin.gq?url=https://site.com&title=title
```

> ### Parameters
| Parameters   | Alias  | Meta                     | Description |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------|
| url=         | u=     | og / twitter:url         | URL/Link you want to share
| title=       | t=     | og / twitter:title       | Preview title
| description= | d=     | og / twitter:description | Description of preview
| image=       | i=     | og / twitter:image       | Preview Image URL/Link
